					Ever since I was a little girl, I would always watch over my mom cook away in the kitchen.
					My mother predominantly makes Polish meals, so by default, it is my favorite food, too. Nothing 
					compares! This site will tell you a little bit more about my hobby for cooking, specifically 
					(as you can probably tell by now) Polish meals and desserts. I will share some of my favorite
					dishes along with a HOW-TO page dedicated to some of my recipes. I hope you consider making some.
					Happy cooking!

					<div class="Mom">
						My mother is my primary inspiration. She grew up in Poland and thus, had a lot of exposure to polish meals there. She had taught me all that I know when it comes to cooking Polish meals. Even when I was too small to reach over the
						counter, I was helping out my mom by passing her ingredients and mixing mixtures. As I got older,
						we've been going all out on holidays and cook feasts for the family since my mom has a more experienced helping hand
						in the kitchen now. I truly am a foodie and find myself looking forward to thinking of new twists/additions to cook and bake.
					</div>
					<div class="favLinks">
						I have a few pages I frequently reference for recipe inspiration. Here they are!

							Like my mom, she's no professional, but a home cook who also grew up in Poland. Now a Polish American, she
							shares her recipes and how she has refined them as she became more experienced.
