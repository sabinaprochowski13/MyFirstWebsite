					<h1> Polish Nalesniki </h1>
					<p> Polish Nalesniki is my number one Polish dish. They are crepe-like pancakes that can have sweet fillings
					(like jelly, fruit, or sweet cheese) or savory fillings such as vegetables (most commonly, mushrooms, potatoes, spinach, or cabbage). They are very easy to make. They take 20 minute tops! They can also be topped
					with jelly or any syrup drizzle to make them even sweeter. Try them now! Refer to my How-To page to learn more.

					<h1> Zapiekanka </h1>
					<p> Zapiekanka is known to be the Polish pizza, a common street food easy to grab and go. It is a toasted open-faced style sandwich. It is a long piece of baguette topped with ingredients like mushroom, cheese, spinach, hams, etc. What may sound weird to you, but trust me it's really good, is that it is drizzled with ketchup. I know what you're thinking. Ketchup on pizza? It's a tradition and definitely compliments the toasty crust. You have to try it! </p>

					<h1> Pierogies </h1>
					<p> Now, it would be wrong for me to not include pierogies on this page. It is what the Poles are known for and it's 
					my cover picture for the header after all. Every Polish household will have these, especially on holidays. Its
					main ingredients are simple: flour, eggs, water, and filling. Though these might take a long time to make, 
					especially if you're making them from scratch and molding them to have the classic pierogi shape, they are 
					mouth-watering. They can be filled with sweet or savory ingredients, most commonly, sauerkraut, fruits, sweet cheese,
					or ground meat. </p>
